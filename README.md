# Network Engineer Virtual Experience - NEVE

I started this project in 17-March-2021 with the purpose of demonstrating my experience in Cisco and networking technologies using projects done in virtualization platforms: [EVE-NG](https://www.eve-ng.net/) and VMware.

## Why?

It's rare to find engineers that have been lucky to work in real life with all the technologies they know or study. So why not presenting their knowledge by using virtual projects of real-life scenarios implementation.

Also, this can be used as a portfolio for network engineers to demonstrate their understanding of the technology and how it can be beneficial/applicable in real-life scenarios.
