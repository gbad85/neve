# Network Engineer Virtual Experience

I started this project in 17-March-2021 with the purpose of demonstrating my experience in Cisco and networking technologies using projects done using virtualization platforms: [EVE-NG](https://www.eve-ng.net/) and VMware.

## Why?

It's rare to find engineers that have been lucky to work in real life with all the technologies they know or study. So why not presenting their knowledge using real-life scenarios implementation using virtual projects?

Also, this can be used as a portfolio for network engineers to demonstrate their understanding of the technology and how it can be beneficial in real-life scenarios.
